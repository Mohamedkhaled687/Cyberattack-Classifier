# ML Task NTI - Final Evaluation

This repository contains the final evaluation project for the ML Task at NTI, focusing on cybersecurity attack classification using the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

## Project Overview

The project implements a machine learning classifier for detecting various types of cyber attacks using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which is a comprehensive network traffic dataset for intrusion detection.

## Files Description

- `app.py` - Main application file with the ML model implementation
- `app copy.py` - Backup/copy of the main application
- `final_eval.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing the evaluation and analysis
- `UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv` - Training dataset for the ML model
- `UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv` - Testing dataset for model evaluation

## Dataset

The UNSW-NB15 dataset contains various types of network attacks and normal traffic, making it suitable for:
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Network Security Analysis
- Machine Learning Model Training
